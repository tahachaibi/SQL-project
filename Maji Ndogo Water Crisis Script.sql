of towns across Akatsi and Hawassa have broken infrastructure.
5. 18% of our people are using wells of which, but within that, only 28% are clean. These are mostly in Hawassa, Kilimani and Akatsi.
6. Our citizens often face long wait times for water, averaging more than 120 minutes:
		â€¢ Queues are very long on Saturdays.
		â€¢ Queues are longer in the mornings and evenings.
		â€¢ Wednesdays and Sundays have the shortest queues.
